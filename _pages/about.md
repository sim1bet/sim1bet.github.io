From January 2026 I will be working at the **Italian Institute of Artificial Intelligence for Industry** ([AI4I](https://ai4i.it/)) as a research fellow (or post-doc) under the supervision of Prof. [Luca Laurenti](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/staff/l.laurenti/). My research centers on **generative diffusion models**, combining techniques from measure theory, probability theory, and stochastic calculus to rigorously analyze their dynamics and robustness. By developing theoretical guarantees on model trajectories, I aim to deepen our fundamental understanding of diffusion models and facilitate their trustworthy adoption in high-impact industrial settings.


I have completed a Ph.D. in **Information Engineering at the University of Padua** under the supervision of Prof. [Sandro Zampieri](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=nq1QPJ0AAAAJ&hl=en), and co-supervised by Prof. [Giacomo Baggio](https://baggiogi.github.io/) and Prof. [Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/). I am working on the mathematical analysis of recurrent neural network models, such as the **Hopfield model and the firing rate model**, using both standard algebraic tools for nonlinear systems and stochastic tools (S.D.E.s, Elliptic P.D.E.s, and Path integrals). 

Since February 2025, I am a member of the IEEE Entrepreneurship and Start-ups commettee for the [IEEE Italy Section](https://italy.ieeer8.org/). 
Join us at DAMA Tecnopolo, in Bologna, for the [_AInnovation Start-up contest 2026_](https://ainnovation2026.ieeesezioneitalia.it/).


My academic goal is understanding how complex cognitive functions emerge from the interaction of simple computational units, and leverage this knowledge to responsibly design smart systems and new technological solutions.


I have lived most of my life in Italy, but throughout the years I have had short stays in the following cities:
* Auckland, New Zealand (2013) - Exchange student at Birkenhead college, 6 months
* Trondheim, Norway (2021) - Erasmus student at NTNU under the supervision of Prof. [Yasser Roudi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-SXPaeYAAAAJ&hl=en), 6 months
* Santa Barbara, CA, USA (2024-2025) - Visiting PhD student at UCSB under the supervision of Prof. [Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/), 9 months
