I am a Ph.D. student in **Information Engineering at the University of Padua** under the supervision of Prof. [Sandro Zampieri](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=nq1QPJ0AAAAJ&hl=en), and co-supervised by Prof. [Giacomo Baggio](https://baggiogi.github.io/) and Prof. [Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/). I am working on the mathematical analysis of recurrent neural network models, such as the **Hopfield model and the firing rate model**, using both standard algebraic tools for nonlinear systems and stochastic tools (S.D.E.s, Elliptic P.D.E.s, and Path integrals). 


My academic goal is understanding how complex cognitive functions emerge from the intraction of simple computational units, and leverage this knowledge to responsibly design smart systems and new technological solutions.
